We can check if an object is manifold by using the 3D print toolbox add-on taht comes with Blender. Even if you don't intend to 3D print, this add-on can be useful.

Enable it just like any other add-on from the preferences add-on section. Once enabled, open the right-hand side tool panel in the 3D viewport by pressing N and find the "3D-Print" tab.

In the clean-up section, you will find a "make manifold" button that will help you solve several potential problems with your mesh object.




Workflow:
		merge by distance
 
		1. deresolute object(reduce polygons/try out optimal)/in objectmode   -> blender reduce faces from right menu (decimate function) 
		2. solidify object -> in blender 3D printing add-on
		3. adjust size -> select object and press s ( scale ) 
		4. Run matlab stl check tool
		

Matlab Criteria:
non manifold edges
non manifold vertices
duplicate Vertices
Slivers
Normal Transition Edges
Free Triangles
T-Vertices
